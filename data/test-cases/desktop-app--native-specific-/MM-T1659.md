## MM-T1659: Prevent browser back/forward from firing in OAuth windows

---

**Step 1**

1. Open Mattermost Desktop
2. Select a server with a plugin that requires an OAuth signin (example: GitHub)
3. In the center channel, type in '/github connect' or whatever command is necessary to trigger the OAuth window
   \
   (may have to use '/github disconnect' first)
4. With the OAuth window open, go to Menu ➜ History ➜ Back

**Expected**

- User should not be able to navigate back/forward in history on the OAuth window.
- The app should not crash or throw any JS errors.
