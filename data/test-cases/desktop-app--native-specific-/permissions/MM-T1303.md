## MM-T1303: Receive a desktop notification

---

**Step 1**

1. View a team, put desktop app in background / minimized
2. Have another user mention you or post a message that will trigger a desktop notification
3. Click the desktop notification

**Expected**

\- Desktop notification fires as expected\
\- Clicking the notification opens the desktop app to that message (assuming the correct team was already being viewed)
