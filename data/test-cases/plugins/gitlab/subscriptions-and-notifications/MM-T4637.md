---

**Step 1**

1\. From the GitLab UI, select \_Pipelines _under _CI/CD_\
2\. Add a pipeline that will be triggered on each commit (the pipeline does not need top succeed or be functional)\
3\. In GitLab add a subscription to a channel that includes the `pipeline` event\
4\. In the GitLab project make a commit that will trigger the pipeline\
5\. Wait for the pipeline to fail or succeed\
