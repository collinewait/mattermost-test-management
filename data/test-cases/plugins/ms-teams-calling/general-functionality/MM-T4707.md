## MM-T4707: Clicking MS Teams button will automatically open new browser tab

---

**Step 1**

1\. Launch a MS Teams meeting using the header icon

**Expected**

\- MS Teams plugin makes a post in the target channel\
\- Without having to click the "Join Meeting" button, a new browser tab will open and prompt the user to launch the meeting (On desktop a browser window will open)
