## MM-T2740: Group is member of another group

---

**Step 1**

Group is member of another group\
————————————————————————————\
E.g. user corey.test does not get added to teams/channels due to links in lower groups such as developers or QA. But lower users such as linda.test do get added to teams/channels linked to groups above her immediate group, such as engineering.

**Expected**

User inherits up, not down
