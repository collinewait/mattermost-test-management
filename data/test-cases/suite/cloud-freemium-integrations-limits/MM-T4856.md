## MM-T4856: system usage limits dashboard data is accurate

---

**Step 1**

1\. Setup a server where the integration limits are being enforced\
2\. Ensure no plugins are enabled\
3\. View the system dashboard\
4\. Enable a core plugin that is not restricted\
5\. View the system dashboard\
6\. Enable 3 non-core plugins and return to the system dashboard\
7\. Enable 2 additional non-core plugins and return to the system dashboard

**Expected**

On 3. Dashboard shows 0/5 integrations running\
On 5. Dashboard still shows 0/5 integrations running as Core plugins do not count\
On 6. Dashboard still shows 3/5 integrations running as Core plugins do not count\
On 7. Dashboard still shows 5/5 integrations running as Core plugins do not count and the top left menu shows the integration limit
