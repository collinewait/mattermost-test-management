## MM-T2609: Upon group filter being removed so the group is back in Mattermost, group is unlinked by default but config is preserved

---

**Step 1**

Upon group filter being removed so the group is back in Mattermost, group is unlinked by default but config is preserved\
————————————————————————————\
Admin adjusts or removes group filter to no longer exclude the group that was excluded in the previous test\
Admin sees the no-longer-excluded group in the Groups list, unlinked\
Click to re-link the group, click Configure\
Observe previously linked team/channels are still linked (config was restored)\
User in previous test who had did not have that previously linked team/channel still doesn't have it/them until sync\
Admin syncs LDAP

**Expected**

On re-linking, previous configuration is restored and new user gets linked team/channel\
After re-linking and sync, existing user gets linked team/channels
