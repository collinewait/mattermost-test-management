## MM-T2612: Change group name on LDAP side

---

**Step 1**

Change group name on LDAP side\
————————————————————————————

- Change the names of two groups on the LDAP side, then sync LDAP:

  - One linked and one unlinked
  - Change at least one of them to something that will change their position in the alphabetical list
  - Change from linked to unlinked and vice-versa
  - Add a channel to the group that is linked and sync

**Expected**

- Group names update after sync
- Alphabetical order adjusted as expected
- Both linked and unlinked groups updated
- Then linking the unlinked and unlinking the linked groups and re-syncing caused no issues (no changes on sync)
- Adding a channel to linked group that had name change successfully added that channel to group member
