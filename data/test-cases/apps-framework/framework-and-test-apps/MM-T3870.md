**Step 1**

1. Add the `SplitKey` needed to your local config.json
2. Login to split.io and locate the split `AppsEnabled`
3. Set the split to `On` and push the changes

_Important notes about this step:_

This test requires an account on Split IO where you have access to the Mattermost organization (invite required)

**Expected**

- `On` enables the plugin
- Disable option is not shown for Cloud Apps as the state cannot be changed by the sysadmin.
